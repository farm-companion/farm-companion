## Completed Work

### 2026-01-17
- Created execution ledger
- Updated twitter-workflow dependencies to resolve Next.js CVE-2025-66478
- Removed all debug console statements from MapShell.tsx (17 statements removed, 2 console.error preserved)
- Fixed MapShell.tsx type safety by replacing all any casts with proper interfaces (FarmMarkerExtended, WindowWithMapUtils)
- Improved cluster event handling: added ClusterData type, show preview for small clusters (<=8 farms), smart zoom for large clusters, proper event validation
- Added desktop marker popovers with screen-position calculation (MapMarkerPopover component, replaces mobile bottom sheet on desktop)
- Consolidated Haversine utilities to shared/lib/geo (deleted lib/geo-utils.ts, moved calculateBearing and isWithinBounds, removed inline implementation from LiveLocationTracker)
- Fixed ClusterPreview data loss: replaced any casts with FarmMarkerExtended type, added validation for missing farm data, prevent render when farms array empty, use farms.length instead of cluster.count for accuracy
- Added WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility utilities to globals.css: touch-target class (44x44px), sr-only for screen readers, skip-to-content link, focus-visible-ring, prefers-reduced-motion support, prefers-contrast high support
