## Completed Work

### 2026-01-19 (God-Tier Transformation - Continues)
- **Queue 8, Slice 2: Semantic Typography System** (COMPLETE)
  - Replaced 12 arbitrary font sizes with 5 semantic scales: display, heading, body, caption, small
  - Added proper letter-spacing and font-weight defaults to semantic scales
  - Kept legacy sizes as deprecated (backward compatible) with migration notes
  - Updated design-tokens.md with semantic typography documentation and migration guide
  - Files changed: tailwind.config.js (+18 lines semantic, kept legacy), design-tokens.md (updated typography section)
  - Visual impact: Typography now uses Apple-style semantic naming (text-display, text-heading, text-body)
  - Migration path: Legacy sizes still work but documented as deprecated

### 2026-01-19 (God-Tier Transformation Begins)
- **Queue 8, Slice 1: Design Token Consolidation (COMPREHENSIVE)** (COMPLETE - REDONE)
  - Added primary color scale (50-900) mapped to serum brand color (#00C2B2)
  - Added secondary color scale (50-900) mapped to solar accent color (#D4FF4F)
  - Added neutral color scale (50-900) for gray tones - replaces hardcoded gray-*
  - Fixed Skeleton.tsx: Uses neutral-* tokens instead of hardcoded gray-*
  - Fixed EmptyState.tsx: Uses semantic text-text-* tokens (heading, body, muted)
  - Created comprehensive design-tokens.md documentation (335 lines)
  - Files changed: tailwind.config.js (+40 lines), Skeleton.tsx (1 line), EmptyState.tsx (3 lines), docs (created)
  - Visual impact: All UI components now use consistent design system tokens

- **Slice 2: Optimized getCategoryStats with Database Aggregation** (Queue 5)
  - Replaced in-memory JavaScript processing with parallel Prisma aggregations in categories.ts

  - Eliminated loading all category farms into memory
- **Audited All Query Files for N+1 Patterns** (Queue 5)
  - counties.ts (319 lines): Already optimized with database aggregations
  - farms.ts (271 lines): Already optimized with parallel queries and raw SQL geospatial
  - geospatial.ts (258 lines): Already optimized with PostGIS (ST_Distance, ST_DWithin, ST_Contains, JSON aggregation)
  - Verified PostGIS fully implemented with spatial indexes
- **Queue 5 Complete**: All backend optimizations verified and complete

### 2026-01-17 (continued)
- Removed final 2 debug console.log statements from MapSearch.tsx (lines 81, 104)
- Verified Track 0 complete: 0 debug logs remain, 2 legitimate warnings preserved (AdvancedMarkerElement fallback, map resize error)

### 2026-01-17 (earlier)
- Created execution ledger
- Updated twitter-workflow dependencies to resolve Next.js CVE-2025-66478

- Added desktop marker popovers with screen-position calculation (MapMarkerPopover component, replaces mobile bottom sheet on desktop)
- Consolidated Haversine utilities to shared/lib/geo (deleted lib/geo-utils.ts, moved calculateBearing and isWithinBounds, removed inline implementation from LiveLocationTracker)
- Fixed ClusterPreview data loss: replaced any casts with FarmMarkerExtended type, added validation for missing farm data, prevent render when farms array empty, use farms.length instead of cluster.count for accuracy
- Added WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility utilities to globals.css: touch-target class (44x44px), sr-only for screen readers, skip-to-content link, focus-visible-ring, prefers-reduced-motion support, prefers-contrast high support
- Added essential layout and utility components: EmptyState (no results/empty lists), Divider (solid/dashed/dotted, horizontal/vertical, with label), Container (responsive max-width layouts), Stack (flexbox with direction/spacing/alignment), all exported from ui/index.ts
- Enhanced design tokens: added semantic feedback colors (success/warning/error/info with light/default/dark shades), premium elevation shadows, updated accessibility tokens (focus ring offset, WCAG AA/AAA values), created comprehensive design-tokens.md documentation with usage guidelines
- Added comprehensive micro-interactions: shake animation (error feedback), success-pop (success states), gentle-pulse (loading), CSS utility classes (hover-lift, hover-scale, press-effect), Tailwind animations config, performance-optimized CSS-only alternatives to Framer Motion

- Verified Queue 7 (Farm pipeline): requirements.txt already has all dependencies pinned, comprehensive retry.py with exponential backoff and jitter, comprehensive logging.py with JSON formatting and structured logging
