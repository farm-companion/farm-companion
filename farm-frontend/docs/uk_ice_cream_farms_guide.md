## South West England

### Roskilly's, Cornwall

**Location:** Tregellast Barton Farm, St Keverne, Helston, Cornwall TR12 6NX

Roskilly's occupies a special place in Cornwall's food heritage. The Roskilly family has farmed this 200-acre organic holding on the Lizard Peninsula since the 1950s, when Joe Roskilly inherited a modest 40-acre farm with just 30 cows. Ice cream production began in 1987, born from the need to diversify following the introduction of milk quotas.

Today, over 100 Jersey cows provide the rich, golden milk that makes Roskilly's ice cream distinctively creamy. The farm achieved full Soil Association organic certification in 1995 and has maintained that status ever since—no pesticides or artificial fertilisers touch this land.

**What to Expect:**
- Free entry to the farm
- Over 30 ice cream flavours including Cream Tea, Golden Fudge, and Banoffee
- Frozen yoghurts and sorbets
- Watch the cows being milked (5am for early risers, or 4.30pm)
- Meet pigs, sheep, geese, and chickens (£1 feed bags available)
- Two miles of woodland walks and pond trails
- Croust House Restaurant serving wood-fired pizzas and farm-reared meat
- On-site pottery with artist Sally Tully (as seen on The Pottery Throwdown)

**Opening:** Year-round (check website for seasonal hours)

### Marshfield Farm, Wiltshire

**Location:** Oldfield Farm, Marshfield, Chippenham, Wiltshire SN14 8LE

Marshfield Farm represents three generations of the Hawking family's dedication to quality ice cream. Will Hawking created his first batch of vanilla in the farmhouse kitchen in 1988, using nothing but milk from the family's cows and the finest natural ingredients. That kitchen operation has grown into a B Corp certified business supplying ice cream parlours, restaurants, and farm shops nationwide.

The farm spans 1,100 acres of Cotswold countryside, home to around 250 British Friesian cows. Certified organic for over 20 years, Marshfield has invested in robotic milking systems that allow cows to choose when they're milked, reducing stress and improving welfare. The milk travels less than 100 metres from cow to creamery.

**What to Expect:**
- Ice cream parlour open weekends, Easter to October (10.30am–5.30pm)
- Over 30 flavours including Clotted Cream, Salted Caramel, and Blackcurrant in Clotted Cream
- Take-home tubs at factory prices
- Views of cows grazing in surrounding fields

### Purbeck Ice Cream, Dorset

**Location:** Lower Scoles Farm, Kingston, Corfe Castle, Dorset

Peter and Hazel Hartle started Purbeck Ice Cream over 30 years ago on their 126-acre farm overlooking Corfe Castle.

They were determined to create ice cream "sooooo much better" than anything they'd encountered on their travels—utterly natural, with no artificial additives or colours.

Purbeck Ice Cream uses 60% local Purbeck milk and 22% Dorset double cream. Everything is gluten-free, egg-free, suitable for vegetarians, and Halal certified (except alcoholic flavours). The business has achieved carbon neutral accreditation, with solar panels powering the cold rooms.

**What to Expect:**

- Award-winning flavours including Dorset Gingerbread (Great Taste winner)
- Multiple Great Taste Awards for consistent quality
- Available at National Trust properties, hotels, beach parlours, and farm shops throughout Dorset

## Planning Your Visit

### What Makes Farm Ice Cream Special?

Farm-made ice cream differs fundamentally from commercial alternatives. The milk travels metres rather than miles, often reaching the dairy within hours of milking. This freshness, combined with higher butterfat content and natural ingredients, creates a richer, creamier product.

Many farms use traditional methods—small batch production, hand-mixing ingredients, and long churning times that incorporate less air than industrial processes. The result is denser ice cream with more intense flavours.

### Best Times to Visit

**Spring/Summer:** Most farms operate extended hours; outdoor play areas open; farm animals often have young; some offer lambing or calving viewing.

**Autumn:** Harvest events, pumpkin picking, apple-themed flavours; quieter visiting.

**Winter:** Many farms close or reduce hours; check websites; Christmas events at larger attractions.

### Tips for Families

- **Arrive early** at popular destinations (especially The Ice Cream Farm) to avoid queues
- **Check weather forecasts**—many play areas are outdoors
- **Bring layers**—farm locations can be breezy
- **Allow extra time** for animal encounters and farm walks
- **Consider midweek visits** during school holidays for quieter experiences
- **Check allergy information** in advance—most farms accommodate dietary requirements

### Supporting British Dairy Farmers

Visiting ice cream farms directly supports British agriculture during challenging times for the dairy industry. Many farms diversified into ice cream production when milk quotas, supermarket pricing pressures, or changing markets threatened their viability. Your visit helps sustain family farming traditions while connecting you with the source of your food.
