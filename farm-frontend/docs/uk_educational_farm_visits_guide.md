Farm visits offer children transformative learning experiences that simply cannot be replicated in a classroom. From watching lambs being born to collecting eggs, milking goats, or discovering where their food comes from, these hands-on encounters stay with young people throughout their lives. The UK has a remarkable network of farms specifically geared towards educational visits, many with CEVAS (Countryside Educational Visits Accreditation Scheme) certification and Learning Outside the Classroom quality badges. Whether you seek a day trip to a local city farm or a life-changing residential week in the countryside, these farms deliver curriculum-linked learning wrapped in unforgettable adventure.

## The Residential Pioneer

### Farms for City Children
*Devon, Gloucestershire & Pembrokeshire*

Founded in 1976 by children's author Sir Michael Morpurgo and his wife Clare, Farms for City Children remains the gold standard for transformative residential farm education. Clare used her inheritance from her father, Sir Allen Lane (founder of Penguin Books), to establish the charity at Nethercott House in Devon, where the first children arrived in January 1976. The programme has since grown to three heritage farms: the original Nethercott House near Iddesleigh in Devon, Wick Court in Gloucestershire (a moated Elizabethan manor house once rumoured to have hosted Elizabeth I), and Lower Treginnis in Pembrokeshire, a 700-year-old farmstead that is the most westerly farm in Wales.

More than 100,000 children have experienced the charity's immersive five-day residential programme, with over 3,000 underserved children and young people (ages 8-19) benefiting annually. During their week-long stays, children engage in purposeful farm work rather than passive observation. Activities include feeding livestock and collecting eggs, grooming ponies and donkeys, herding sheep, working in kitchen gardens, making butter and yoghurt, and even whittling wood and building dens. The farms are proudly screen-free, swapping digital distractions for analogue adventures. HRH The Princess Royal serves as patron, and the charity holds CEVAS accreditation across all sites. Michael Morpurgo has spoken of how a relationship between a stammering boy and a horse at Nethercott partly inspired his novel War Horse.

Spanning 700 acres in the Durham countryside, Hall Hill Farm has been in the Gibson family since 1925 and first opened to visitors in 1981. The farm has become a beacon of educational excellence in the North East, winning the National Award for Best in Education in 2014 and achieving runner-up status in 2015 and 2016.

Tractor and trailer rides offer views of the surrounding countryside. Three barn classrooms provide covered spaces for picnic lunches, and teacher information packs aligned with the National Curriculum are included along with comprehensive risk assessments.

### Adam Henson's Cotswold Farm Park
*Guiting Power, Cheltenham, Gloucestershire GL54 5FL*

This Gloucestershire landmark stands as the home of rare breed conservation, established in 1970 by Joe Henson, father of BBC Countryfile presenter Adam Henson.

The park houses over 50 flocks and herds of rare and traditional breed farm animals, from Gloucestershire Old Spot pigs to Highland cattle, offering visitors an unparalleled journey through the history of British farming.

Educational visits can be either guided or self-led. Guided visits (from £8.50 per child with one free adult per five children) include a structured timetable of activities, reserved lunch seating, animal snacks, and comprehensive teacher resources.

## History Brought to Life

### Kentwell Hall
*Long Melford, Suffolk CO10 9BA*

Kentwell Hall offers something entirely unique: full immersion time-travel to Tudor England. This magnificent moated Tudor house, with origins recorded in the Domesday Book of 1086, has hosted historical re-enactments since 1979. Over 500,000 schoolchildren from as far afield as Japan have visited to experience these extraordinary recreations, where over 100 costumed living historians from all levels of Tudor society go about their daily business speaking, behaving, and working as though the visitor has genuinely stepped back in time.

School visits last approximately three and a half hours, during which students experience over 20 hands-on activities spread throughout the house, gardens, and rare-breeds farm. From food preparation and longbow archery to music, dance, and traditional crafts, the curriculum links extend far beyond history into language, science, and geography. Tudor Midsummer Schools Only Days typically take place in late June, suitable for Key Stage 2 through GCSE students. The distinctive feature is total immersion without a break, allowing children to genuinely feel they have visited the foreign country that is the past. Primary-aged pupils are encouraged to dress in simple period-style clothes to enhance the experience.

This Tower Hamlets charity brings a slice of countryside to urban families and school groups, operating as a unique outdoor classroom for all ages and abilities.

### Lee Valley Park Farms

Guided tours through the Youth and Schools Service cover the crops that feed the cows, inspection of milking machinery, and close-up experiences in the calf shed.

### Wimpole Home Farm
*Wimpole Estate, Arrington, Royston, Cambridgeshire SG8 0BW*

This model for sustainable farming practices sits within a 3,000-acre estate featuring a Georgian mansion, parkland, and extensive gardens. The farm operates as one of the UK's largest rare-breed centres, playing a key role in conserving traditional livestock breeds. From Shire horses to newly born piglets, there's a wide range of farm animals to meet.

School groups can benefit from an Education Group Access Pass offering free admission and parking across National Trust properties for a year. The estate welcomes self-led educational visits, with teachers able to contact the property to plan curriculum-linked days covering history, conservation, and agricultural knowledge. The 750-acre organic arable farm is one of the few organic farms in the area, producing wheat, rye, and spelt for organic breads, oats for porridge, and barley for beer. Little Acorns, the popular pre-school group, offers relaxed sessions for younger children with stories, songs, and activities inspired by the estate.

## Planning Your Educational Visit

A successful farm visit requires thorough preparation. Most accredited farms provide comprehensive risk assessments, but teachers should always conduct a pre-visit to familiarise themselves with the site, discuss planned activities, check relevance to curriculum objectives, and review hazards. LEAF Education Regional Consultants work throughout England and Wales and can help identify farms offering visits and integrate food, farming, and countryside topics into your curriculum.

Look for farms with CEVAS accreditation or the Learning Outside the Classroom Quality Badge, as these demonstrate nationally recognised standards of safety and quality. The Country Trust offers free Farm Discovery visits to eligible disadvantaged schools and groups, while the AHDB School Farm Visit Support Programme helps farmers develop skills to host educational visits, expanding the network of welcoming farms across England and Wales.

Practical considerations include appropriate clothing (wellies are essential, weather-appropriate layers recommended), supervision ratios appropriate to your pupils' ages and needs, handwashing facilities and their use before eating, and transport arrangements confirmed well in advance. Many farms offer discounted coach services or can recommend local operators. Remember that farm animals carry germs, so thorough handwashing at the start and end of visits is non-negotiable.
