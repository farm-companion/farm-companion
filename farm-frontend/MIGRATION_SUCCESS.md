# ✅ DATABASE MIGRATION COMPLETE

> **Historical note (2026-05-22):** This document records the original January 2026 database migration into Supabase. In May 2026 the backing services (Postgres, Redis, Meilisearch) migrated again, this time to Coolify-managed Hetzner; blob storage moved to Hetzner Object Storage. References to Supabase below are point-in-time accurate for the January 2026 migration this document records. The current production stack is documented in the Production Infrastructure block of `docs/assistant/execution-ledger.md`.

**Date**: January 16, 2026
**Status**: Successfully migrated 1,299 farms to PostgreSQL

## Duplicate IDs in Source Data

23 farms were skipped because they have duplicate IDs in the source JSON. These are data quality issues:

**Farms with Duplicate IDs:**
- Manor Farm Shop (appears 2x)
- The Farm Shop (appears 4x)
- Grange Farm Shop (appears 2x)
- Ben's Farm Shop (appears 2x)
- The Egg Shed (appears 2x)
- Norvite Farm & Country
- Hilltop Farm Shop
- The Milk Shed
- Park Farm Shop
- Daylesford Organic
- Bridge Farm Shop
- Farm Shop (appears 2x)
- Mwanaka Fresh Farm Foods
- Clearview Farm Shop
- Brookfield Farm Shop

**Resolution Options:**
1. **Ignore** - 1,299 farms is 98.3% coverage, very good
2. **Manual cleanup** - Generate new UUIDs for duplicates and add them separately
3. **Deduplicate** - Merge duplicate entries in source JSON first

**Recommendation**: Proceed with 1,299 farms. The missing 23 are mostly generic-named duplicates that likely represent data quality issues anyway.

## Connection Configuration

Your `.env` is now configured with:

```env
# Pooler connection for queries and data operations
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://postgres.baxnifiqtnnovifnamlk:DDA3KCYM1Wjknr6w@aws-1-eu-west-2.pooler.supabase.com:6543/postgres?pgbouncer=true"
```

**Important Notes:**
- ✅ Pooler connection works for queries (SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE)
- ⚠️ Pooler does NOT work for schema changes (CREATE TABLE, ALTER TABLE)
- 💡 For future schema changes, use Supabase SQL Editor

---

## Verification

**Prisma Studio** is running at: http://localhost:5556

You can:
- Browse all 1,299 farms
- Check data integrity
- View county distribution
- Verify location data (lat/lng)

**Query Examples:**

```bash
# Count farms by county
SELECT county, COUNT(*) as count FROM farms GROUP BY county ORDER BY count DESC LIMIT 10;

# Find verified farms
SELECT name, county, googleRating FROM farms WHERE verified = true;

# Check farms with highest ratings
SELECT name, county, googleRating FROM farms WHERE googleRating IS NOT NULL ORDER BY googleRating DESC LIMIT 20;
```
