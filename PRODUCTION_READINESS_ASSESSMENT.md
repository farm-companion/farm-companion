## üö® **TASKMASTER FINAL VERDICT**

### **CURRENT STATUS: üü° NOT READY FOR PRODUCTION**

**REASONING:**
1. **Accessibility compliance not verified** - This is a legal requirement
2. **Security testing not completed** - Critical for user data protection
3. **Performance validation pending** - User experience depends on this

**RECOMMENDATION:**
**STOP** - Do not deploy to production until all critical validations are completed.

**NEXT STEPS:**
1. Complete all security testing
2. Achieve WCAG 2.2 AA compliance
3. Validate performance in production-like environment
4. Complete infrastructure validation
5. Re-run this assessment
